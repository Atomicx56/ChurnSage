ChurnSage: AI-Powered Customer Churn Prediction and Risk Assessment System

Project Overview 
ChurnSage is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to help businesses predict customer churn with high accuracy. It empowers organizations to proactively identify at-risk customers, understand key churn drivers, and implement strategic interventions to improve customer retention. The system is built using Streamlit for an interactive web-based UI, **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning, **Plotly** and Seaborn for visual analytics, and Pandas for efficient data handling.  

This solution is ideal for customer success teams, business analysts, and data-driven organizations that want to enhance customer retention strategies through AI-driven insights.

Key Features and Functionalities

 üè† Home Page
- A visually appealing landing page that introduces users to ChurnSage and its capabilities.  
- Provides an overview of how the system can help businesses analyze customer behavior and predict churn.  

 üìÅ Upload Customer Data  
- Users can upload a CSV dataset containing customer information.  
- The system automatically detects and processes numerical and categorical data.  
- Missing values are handled using imputation techniques (median for numerical values, mode for categorical values).  
- The system attempts to identify the churn-related column automatically.  

 ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training & Prediction
- Users can select relevant features to train a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
- The model is trained using **RandomizedSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters.  
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.  
- **Feature importance analysis** helps users understand which factors contribute most to churn.  
- The final model is stored for real-time predictions on new data.  

üìä Results & Visual Analytics  
- Displays model accuracy and key performance metrics.  
- Generates a **churn rate distribution pie chart** using Plotly to visualize the proportion of customers leaving.  
- Provides an interactive **feature importance bar chart** to highlight the most influential factors in customer churn.  
- Includes a **Risk Assessment System**, categorizing customers into **Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk** groups based on churn probability.  
- Provides **strategic recommendations** tailored to different risk groups to reduce churn effectively.  

üîÆ Predict Churn for New Customers 
- Users can upload a new dataset for **batch predictions** on unseen customers.  
- The system preprocesses the new data to match the trained model‚Äôs feature set.  
- Predictions include **churn probability and risk categorization**.  
- Alternatively, users can manually enter customer details for **single-customer predictions**.  
- Provides actionable insights based on prediction results.
